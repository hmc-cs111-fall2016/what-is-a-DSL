# Language
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)


# Domain
Creating bot clients for Discord


# Computational model
The Python interpreter executes the program as it would Python code.


# DSL-ness
Extremely domain specific. This cannot be used to do anything other than creating Discord bots.


# Internal or external?
This is an internal language. It is all valid python code and is meant to be interpreted as such.


# Host language
Python


# Benefits
This greatly lessens the development time of Discord bots as you don't need to learn the
intricacies of the HTTP API or any other network information. The program reads more as
and event reaction program than dealing with netcode.


# Drawbacks
This is an additional section of code that would have to be maintained and updated as Discord added more features or changed existing ones.
