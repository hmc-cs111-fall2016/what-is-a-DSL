# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
+ContextFree can be used by people who want to create digital images, +especially those that involve repeating structures, through some simple +programming.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
+It is quite easy to create images that involve many repeating shapes because +you can create multiples of many shapes and manipulate them using recursion.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
+It is more difficult to create organic shapes and lines in this language +because you are essentially limited to three basic shapes: squares, circles, +and triangles. It is much different from physically drawing something because +you need to program every part of the image. So while it is very easy to make +repetitive patterns it is hard to create something that looks more free form +and natural.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
+I learned through the two lessons and the examples that were included in the +ContextFree program, through the documentation on the ContextFree website, +and as always, by simply playing around with the program and making many +mistakes!

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._
+The user is basically creating images by writing code that corresponds to the +output of shapes in different formations. Blocks of code, called “rules”, +each describe some element of the image. These rules can be called within +other rules, and you can even call a rule within itself, allowing for +recursive images (the recursion ends when the shape becomes too small to see).+The main rule takes on the name of the “startshape”, and all other rules must +be called within that main rule in order to be used.

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
+I think peacocks have really interesting symmetry and repeating features, and +I was able to use the methodological nature of ContextFree programming in +order to create a geometric peacock.
