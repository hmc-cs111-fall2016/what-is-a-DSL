# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
People who want to create digital art. 

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
It is easy to create images recursively with the looping syntax - things like spiral, snowflakes and trees. It's also easy to implement randomness by creating different versions of a shape and assigning weights to them. 

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
It is hard to draw precise images without patterns in this language. Getting shapes to appear in the right position is like playing around with CSS - it involves quite a bit of experimentation - and only having primitive shapes to draw things is quite limiting. Images that have many unique parts to them would be very hard and tedious to draw. For instance, a portrait of a face (even if we assume it's perfectly symmetric) would require hundreds of unique lines and colors. 

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
At first, I read through the documentation to get a feel for the syntax and "words" of the language. Once I had understood the basics, I moved onto playing around with the examples, experimenting with different values to see the results and understand how the language works. Whenever I was unsure of how something worked I consulted the documentation on Github. 


## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

The program renders the shapes in the order that the syntax references them, from the top to the bottom. In the more complicated programs we can see this process unfold. 


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
It was interesting to see how a simple rule could be reused to create a picture of a shrimp.
