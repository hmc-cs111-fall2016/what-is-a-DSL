# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
People who want to create primarily math/geometry-based images in a
 (relatively) simple way. 

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
Creating images made up of a repitition of the same shape at a smaller
size because the recursion available leads naturally to this.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
Making images appear where you want them to is difficult because you
either have to do a lot of math or a lot of experimentation. It is 
also difficult to create a complex shape since the language only provides
basic ones and as mentioned positioning is not intuitive. 


## How did you learn how to program in this language?
By reading over the documentation on github and mostly by expirimenting
and seeing what happened. 


## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._
It seems like it reads each instruction given separately and interprets it as
an image, while storing the current "state" for the next instruction to be 
interpreted in the context of.

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
It produces a fairly detailed spiral-flower, which I think is pretty in a 
surprisingly small amount of code.
