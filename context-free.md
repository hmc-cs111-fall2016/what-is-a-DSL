# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

This programming language is for people who want to create art on the computer 
through rules. Instead of using a mouse to point and click like you would in 
paint, you rather create mathematical rules that creates art.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

It is easy to do recursive shapes. It is easy because the language allows you 
to define rules with itself.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

It is hard to do arbitrary shapes. If you wanted to draw letters, you have to 
define multiple different and somewhat repetitive rules. It's nice to have the 
render button to show you what you did immediately, but complex arbitrary 
shapes still take a while. In the end this is because the rules do not cater 
to this.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

I learned how to program in this language by looking at examples and searching 
for online tutorials.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

The underlying computational model of ContextFree is to render shapes as 
they are defined in their own rules in the program.


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

The most interesting thing about ContextFree is how easy it is to make 
recursive shapes. I made the dark circle extremely easily. In contrast, it was 
painstaking how long it took to create a short simple line. It really showed 
the strengths and purposes of ContextFree, where it excels in creating random 
and recursive images like trees, but it isn't that great at creating arbitrary 
shapes (as I've mentioned above).
