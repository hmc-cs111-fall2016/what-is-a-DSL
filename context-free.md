# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
It is for image designers or graphical artists. 

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
It is really easy to make squares, circles, and triangles of various colors, shapes, sizes, and locations.
Its also very easy to make other shapes that build off triangles, circles, or squares to make a 
more complicated figure. 

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
Firstly, its impossible to do anything but make images (or so it seems) . Secondly, I thought it was hard to make non circular, square, or triangular shapes at because the base shapes are very basic. For example, to make a smile I had to use miniature squares put together which is not very intuitive. 

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
The documentation confused me so I mainly looked at examples to figure out how to change the colors and the different syntax.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

WHen I hit render, a text parser figures out the rule definitions written and 
what rules they are based off of (for example my arc is based off of squares). 
It then probably uses the rule definitions to determine which pixels need to be colored. 
Then using the coloring definitions, it puts a color at that pixel in the canvas. 


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
I think it is interesting because not only is it the Classic CS5 Alien but also it used little squares 
to make a smiley face and showed off how easy it is to make a "creature" in this program.
