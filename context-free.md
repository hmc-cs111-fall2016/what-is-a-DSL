# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

Context Free if for people who want to quickly make random and mathematically
inspired animations and pictures. (Although it may not be entirely intended to
make animations, the slow renderer combined with the time commands make it a
possible use case.)

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

It is easy to make pattern filled, recursive, and random images due to the
nature of the language.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

It is hard to create pictures of non-organic items (or perhaps my artistic
skills and familiarity with the language need more developing).

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

At first, I began looking through the documentation directly, but quickly
realized learning a coding language destined for visual design was better suited
for experimentation, so I switched to looking at sample images on the Context
Free website.

By looking and downloading the source and investigating how the
images "worked"&mdash;a combination of reading more of the documentation as
needed and experimentally commenting lines out and adjusting values then
analyzing its effect on the final image&mdash;I was able to (partially) grasp
the language.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language?
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model".
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

Although you cannot observe it in the still PNG image, the iterative nature of
my image makes it especially fun to watch it come to life. As it is being
rendered, there are swirls of color that eventually come together to create the
rainbow sphere.
