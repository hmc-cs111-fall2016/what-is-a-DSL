# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

Anyone who is interested in creating procedurally generated art.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

Creating self similar images is very straight forward due to the way the rules call each other.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

Controlling randomness seems a bit hard. It would be nice to do something other than just
trying a bunch of different seeds to see what works.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

By looking at examples, both online and other students' submissions.


## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 

I presume the program gets parsed and a grammar built. Then the grammar gets effectively
enumerated following each rule to produce the picture.

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

I was trying to make a Dragon Curve, but I found that if you didn't reverse the fold
each time this is what resulted instead. I liked this better.
